  # Class methods will be defined above initialize by convention
  # and instance methods will be defined below initialize

  # ✅ Because we'll be inheriting from ActiveRecord::Base now, some of these methods will be defined in the Base class for us, so we can remove them from the Dog class:
  # We can remove the following:
  
  # --- @@all
  # --- def self.all
  # --- def self.new_from_row
  # --- def self.create
  # --- all attr_accessors & attr_reader
  # --- def initialize 
  # --- def save

  # We'll want to leave our custom methods that work with instances within the CLI, but all of the code related to persistence can be removed as we'll be using the versions of those methods defined in the ActiveRecord::Base class instead.
